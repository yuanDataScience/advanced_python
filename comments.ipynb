    "We may have objects that are created from a variety of sources. For example, we might need to clone an object as part of creating a memento, or freeze an object so that it can be used as the key of a dictionary or placed into a set; this is the idea behind the set and frozenset built-in classes.\n",
    "We'll look at two design patterns that offer multiple ways to build an object. One design pattern uses a complex __init__() method with multiple strategies for initialization. This leads to designing the __init__() method with a number of optional parameters. The other common design pattern involves creating multiple static or class-level methods, each with a distinct definition.\n",
    "Defining an overloaded __init__() method can be confusing to mypy, because the parameters may have distinct value types. This is solved by using the @overload decorator to describe the different assignments of types to the __init__() parameters. The approach is to define each of the alternative versions of\n",
    "__init__() and decorate with @overload. A final version – without any decoration – defines the parameters actually used for the implementation.\n",

    "In the first overloaded case, a Hand3 instance has been built from an existing Hand3 object. In the second case, a Hand3 object has been built from individual Card instances. The @overload decorator provides two alternative versions of the __init__() method. These are used by mypy to ensure this constructor is used properly. The undecorated version is used at runtime. It is a kind of union of the two overloaded definitions.\n",
    "The @overload definitions are purely for mypy type-checking purposes. The non- overloaded definition of __init__() provides a hint for arg1 as union of either a Card object or a Hand3 object. The code uses the isinstance() function to decide which of the two types of argument values were provided. To be more robust, the if-elif statements should have an else: clause. This should raise a ValueError exception.\n",
