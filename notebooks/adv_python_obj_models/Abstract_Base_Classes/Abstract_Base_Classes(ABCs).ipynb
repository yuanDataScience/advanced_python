    "  + BroadSword class already meetws the requirements of its base class by providing the override of the swipe method, and we can instantiate it.\n",
    "  + if we add any extra abstract method with @abstractmethod decorator in Sword class, even with a meaningful implementation, we will not be able to instantiate BroadSword class\n",
    "    + to fix that, we just need to implement it in BroadSword class, even by just calling super().parry() is enough\n",
    "+ the reqirements that all abstract methods in abstract base class are implemented to instantiate a subclass only applies to real subclasses of the abstract base class, not the virtual subclasses.\n",
    "  + in example code, SamuraiSword class, even though didn't implement parry() method, can still be instantiated\n",
    "  + we add that check into dunder subclasshook method, and we implement parry() method in SamuraiSword class rather than delegating it to super().parry() (there is no inheritance between BroadSword and Sword)\n",
    "+ to accomodate LightSabre class, we changed the shapen method in the Sword class to maintain, and add that as an abstract method to Sword class, so all sword subclasses inheriting Sword class will need to implement it. We also add that requirement to the dunder subclasshook so all virtual subclass will need to implement that mehtod to be considered as a sub class (still not required for instantiation)  "

    "Version 4: using multiple class decorators\n",
    "* we add another outer class decorator to restrict the highest temperature\n",
    "* if we test the function decorators by directly setting kelvin, both high and low decorators worked\n",
    "* if we test the property decorators (descriptors), the inner decorator is broken\n",
    "  + this is because after the inner decorator, the property has become descriptor class, which didn't pass the isinstance(member,property) test. As a result, the two decorators should produce two descriptors, each for one decorator, but now, we only have one descriptor that only process the outer decorator's check \n",
    "    + Actually, isinstance can accept a collection of types against which to check, so we just need to add InvariantProperty to it.\n",
    "    + a more general soultion is to use an abstract base class of both built-in property and InvariantProperty descriptor.\n",
    "* in the following code example, we defined an ABC class, AbstractPropery which defines 3 abstractmethod for subclass to implement (we know both built-in Propery and our InvariantProperty classes have implemented these methods), and the dunder isabstactmethod property\n",
    "  + we directly register the built-in property as the virtual subclass of AbstractProperty\n",
    "    + property is a kind of third party type for which we can't modify the code\n",
    "    + property has a highly general descriptor interface that is too general for easy \\_\\_subclasshook\\_\\_ implementation\n",
    "  + for our own defined InvariantProperty class, we make it inherit AbstractProperty class\n",
    "* finally, we changed the get and set methods for \\_kelvin to be a property since now property can be correctly handled by descriptor"
