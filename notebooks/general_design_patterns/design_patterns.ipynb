    "  + designin classes for ducks\n",
    "    + flying and quacking get no benefits from inheritance unless most of the descedents have common behaviors\n",
    "      + otherwise, we will have to override these methods in the descendent classes\n",
    "      + the problem is that although we organize all the ducks in a hierarchy of classes\n",
    "        + we don't get huge benefits reuse benefits\n",

    "    + every duck just implement its own fly and quack method\n",

    "      + we probably will have to look at the code in every one of the classes and make changes\n",

    "* when we have to use many if-else to make run-type decisions about which concrete class to instantiate\n",
    "  + if we have to add new classes, we will have to change this code, which violates open-close principle\n",
    "  + we may also need to write these same if-else in several places, which makes things worse\n",
    "  + the solution is to find what varies, separate and encapsulate it\n",
    "* the simple factory pattern\n",
    "  + we separate the if-else statement into a separate, factory class that will create concrete class objects\n",
