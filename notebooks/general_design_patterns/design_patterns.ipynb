    "#### Problems of inheritance\n",
    "* inheritance is one of of the core concept of OOD\n",
    "  + you can express class relationship that allows you to reuse and extend the behavior and properties of other classes\n",
    "  + code reuse is alway touted as the main benefit of inheritance\n",
    "  + typical one class inheriting from another, if they share a is-a relationship\n",
    "    + we reuse the implementation of classes we inherit from \n",
    "* it is also easy to overdo inheritance and make it the basis of all your OOD\n",
    "  + if all your class relationship are is-a relationships, take a closer look at your design\n",
    "  + when you over use inheritance, you can end up with design that are inflexible and difficult to change\n",
    "* example of the problem of inheritance\n",
    "  + designin classes for ducks\n",
    "    + flying and quacking get no benefits from inheritance unless most of the descedents have common behaviors\n",
    "      + otherwise, we will have to override these methods in the descendent classes\n",
    "      + the problem is that although we organize all the ducks in a hierarchy of classes\n",
    "        + we don't get huge benefits reuse benefits\n",
    "        + we have code duplicated across classes\n",
    "          + code keeps ducks from quacking and flying\n",
    "        + it is hard to gain knowledge of all the ducks by looking at the super class\n",
    "            + we have to go to each concrete class to learn more about what the code does\n",
    "        + changes in the super class can affect other ducks\n",
    "        + duck's behaviors are defined at compile time, we can't change duck's behavior at run time\n",
    "          + for example, change the fly behavior when injured or captured\n",
    "    + the design can not provide the flexibility as we need when application become complicated \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### what about interface?\n",
    "* an interface defines the methods an object must have in order to be considered a particular type\n",
    "* an interace is an abstract type that specifies a behavior tha classes must implement\n",
    "* interface allow different classes to share similarities\n",
    "* not all classes need to have the same behavior\n",
    "  + you can have some flyable ducks that implement flyable interface\n",
    "* a solution to implment duck classes using interface: \n",
    "  + separate the fly and quack method into flyable and quackable interface\n",
    "    + only flyable ducks implement flyable interface\n",
    "    + only quakable ducks implement quackable interace    \n",
    "  + super class only keep swim and display method that all ducks will have\n",
    "    + display is an abstract method for different subclass to implement different display\n",
    "  + the problem of this solution is that it destroys code reuse\n",
    "    + every duck just implement its own fly and quack method\n",
    "    + any changes to fly and quack becomes a maintenance nightmare\n",
    "      + we probably will have to look at the code in every one of the classes and make changes\n",
    "    + it does not allow for runtime changes in behaviors (duck just starting life can not fly etc.)   \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### an overview of our attempts\n",
    "* inheritance didn't work well when we have lots of ducks having different behaviors\n",
    "  + behavior chagnes across subclasses, and it is not appropriate for all subclasses to have all behaviors\n",
    "    + this causes code duplication and limited our ability to use inheritance\n",
    "* interfaces didn't work well\n",
    "  + makes code cleaner to organize from OOD perspective\n",
    "  + destroy the re-usability since interfaces supply no implementation and eac class will implement its methods\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Encapsulate what varies principle\n",
    "* identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same\n",
    "  + to apply this duck classes, fly and quack will change when more subclasses are added\n",
    "    + we need to pull out these methods from rest of the code and encapsulate them\n",
    "    + by separating out the parts of your code that change, you can extend or alter them without affecting the rest of your code\n",
    "* this principle is fundamental to almost every design pattern\n",
    "  + each pattern tends to provide a unique way to achieving this\n",
    "* to implement this principle for duck classes, we will use the next principle: program to an interface  \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### program to an interface, not an implementation\n",
    "* clients remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use, as long as the objects adhere to the interface that clients expect\n",
    "* we should use the super type rather than the specific object type to refer to objects\n",
    "* the way we used interface is that we still relied on subclass to implement fly and quack behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### the strategy pattern\n",
    "* this pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable. This lets the alogrithm vary independently from clients that use it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### has-a is better than is-a\n",
    "* is-a is an inheritance relationship and has-a is a composition relationship\n",
    "* we are using a has-a relationship\n",
    "  + each duck has a FlyBehavior and a QuackBehavior\n",
    "* instead of inheriting behavior, we are composing it\n",
    "  + a duck is composed with a fly behavior and a quack behavior\n",
    "  + now instead of inherit that behavior, the object can delegate behavior to the composed object\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### favor composition over inheritance\n",
    "* classes sould achieve code reuse using composition rather than inheritance from a superclass\n",
    "* this is because typically, composition leads to flexible design\n",
    "* strategy pattern complies to the following principle by including interface\n",
    "* in inheritance, we are locked into compile time decisions about behavior. our duck has only one way to fly\n",
    "* in composition, a duck can have different fly behavior\n",
    "  + rather than limiting use by one specific implementation of behavior, we can use any concrete behavior implemented as fly behavior\n",
    "  + composition gives us a whole new family of algorithms \n",
    "  + composition is often used in design technique\n",

    "  + design pattern:\n",
    "    + create a class TurkeyAdapter that implements Duck interface\n",
    "    + TurkeyAdapter class has a Turkey object that is initialized in its constructor \n",
    "      + you MUST have a non-abastract Turkey subclass to be included in TurkeyAdapter class\n",

    "    + implement duck's fly method using turkey's fly method\n",
    "  + how to use\n",
    "    + client contains Duck objects and calls the Duck object methods\n",
    "    + in the client create a TurkeyAdpater object by passing a turky object to its onstructor \n",
    "    + since TurkeyAdaptor object implements the Duck interface, we can call duck's methods on TurkeyAdapter object\n",
    "* Adapters use composition\n",
    "  + the client needs to call methods of the target inteface\n",
    "    + in order to do that, we composed the client with the adapter that implements the target interface\n",
    "  + inside the adapter class, it contains the adaptee\n",
    "  + adapter delegates calls from client to the adaptee, and returns any needed value \n",
