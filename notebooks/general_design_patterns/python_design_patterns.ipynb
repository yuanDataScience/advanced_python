    "### types of design patterns\n",
    "* Creational Patterns\n",
    "  + used to create objects systematically\n",
    "  + benefits: provides flexibility when creating objects, for example, different subtypes of objects from the same class can be created at runtime\n",
    "  + polymorphism is often used\n",
    "* Structural Patterns\n",
    "  + establish relationships between software components to assemble classes and their instances\n",
    "  + accomplish both functioal and nonfunctional goals\n",
    "  + different goals will use different structures\n",
    "  + take advantage of inheritance \n",
    "* Behavioral Patterns \n",
    "  + define object interactions to accomplish both functional and nonfunctional goals\n",
    "  + the focus is to define the protocols between these objects, and make them work together to accomplish a common goal \n",
    "  + use methods and their signatures a lot\n",
    "* interfaces are used in all the three types of design patterns\n",
    "### Pattern context\n",
    "* participants\n",
    "  + classes involved to form a design pattern\n",
    "  + different classes play different roles in a pattern\n",
    "* quality attributes\n",
    "  + nonfunctional requirements including usability, modifiability, reliability, performance, and more\n",
    "  + impact the entire software (addressed by architecture solutions)\n",
    "* forces\n",
    "  + various factors or trade-offs to consider\n",
    "  + manifested in quality attributes\n",
    "  + unintended consequences\n",
    "* consequences\n",
    "  + worse performance\n",
    "  + decision makers should consider consequences when considering to use a pattern\n",
    "### Design patterns and Architecture patterns\n",
    "* design patterns\n",
    "  + at the class level\n",
    "  + address how classes are instantiated, structured and orchestrated\n",
    "  + have local impact, not affect the entire software as a whole, e.g. singleton which only restrict the number of objects instantiated from the same class\n",
    "* architectural patterns\n",
    "  + high level and abstract\n",
    "  + at the module level\n",
    "  + address global concerns about quality attributes, including security, performance, maintainability, ect.\n",
    "  + have global impact\n",
    "    + The quality attribute that are impacted most is the maintainability\n",
    "    + e.g. MVC is an architecture pattern which has direct impact on the overall quality of software\n",
    "    + by separating the responsibility into three distinct modules, and limiting the changes to unaffected modules, MVC improves software modifiability\n",
    "      + if a user interface needs to be changed, controller and model modules don't need to be change\n",
    "* framework\n",
    "  + collection of reusable software elements\n",
    "  + implement design patterns\n",
    "  + allow developers to reuse code through application programming interfaces (APIs)\n",
    "  + many domain-specific software components such as security have commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and open-source frameworks\n",
    "    + serveral frameworks are available for Authentication and suport various programming languages\n",
    "### Design best practice\n",
    "* Quality attributes and design patterns\n",
    "  + quality attributes include non-functional requirements\n",
    "    + performance\n",
    "    + security\n",
    "    + maintainability\n",
    "  + design patterns are more directly related to functional  buand non-functional requirements\n",
    "    + adapter pattern used to connect your app to different databases, such as Oracle and MySQL fufills functional requirements\n",
    "    + if consistently used, the apdaptor pattern promotes maintainability of software by containing the change in a single, isolated location instead of widespread code modifications "

    "  * different strategies need to be applied to a class method/function\n",
    "* use case:\n",
    "  + Item class needs to apply a variety of different discount strategy\n",
    "  + discount strategies are implemented as different functions\n",
    "  + a strategy function is passed to the class constructor to instantiate a class object applying that strategy\n",
    "* advantages:\n",
    "  + open/close principle: easy to introduce new strategies without changing client code\n",
    "  + isolation: isolate the specific implementation details of the algorithms from the client's code\n",
    "  + encapsulation: data structure used for implementing the algorithm are completely encapsulated in Strategy class. Therefore, the implementation of an algorithm can be changed without affecting the Context class \n",
    "    + here Context class is the interface/abstract class of the strategy function\n",
    "  + Run-time switch: application can switch the strategies at the run-time\n",
    "* disadvantages:\n",
    "  + creating extra objects: needs to create and maintain both strategy class instance and strategy function object\n",
    "  + awareness among clients: need to understand the difference between strategies to apply them\n",
    "  + increases the complexity: no need to implement if there are only a few algorithms to implement"
