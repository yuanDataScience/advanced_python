    "* advantages:\n",
    "  + open/close principle: easy to introduce new strategies without changing client code\n",
    "  + isolation: isolate the specific implementation details of the algorithms from the client's code\n",
    "  + encapsulation: data structure used for implementing the algorithm are completely encapsulated in Strategy class. Therefore, the implementation of an algorithm can be changed without affecting the Context class \n",

    "  + allows you to dynamically attach new behaviors/features to existing object without changing their structure or using subclassing\n",
    "  + generall, we implement by placing these objects inside the wrapper objects that contains the behviors\n",
    "  + It is much easier to implement Decorator pattern in Python because of its built-in feature\n",
    "  + note that Decorator pattern is different from inheritance because the new feature is added only to that particular object, not to the entire subclass\n",
    "* use case\n",
    "  + we need add HTML decoration tags around the input text\n",
    "  + we want to combine these decorators in all possible orders \n",
    "* advantages\n",
    "  + single responsibility principle: it is easy to divide a monolithic class which implements many possible variants of behavior into several classes using Decorator Pattern\n",
    "  + Runtime Responsibilities: we can easily add or remove the responsibilities from an object at runtime\n",
    "  + subclassing: The decorator pattern is an alternative to subclassing. Subclassing adds behavior at compile time, and the changes affect all instances of the original class. Decorating can provide new behavior at runtime for individual objects\n",
    "* disadvantages\n",
    "  + complicated decorators: it can be complicated to have decorators keep track of other decorators\n",
    "  + ugly configuration: large number of code of layer might make the configurations ugly\n"
